## Overview

Theme is my custom Visual Studio Code theme. It is an extended version of the One Dark Pro theme by Binaryify. I made it simply because I had certain style changes that I would have liked to make, but they were not possible in their extension on the marketplace.

1. Styling (`/themes`)

   - Contains all the JSON data used to style the colors of the editor.
  
  1. Images (`/images`)

   - The images folder serves as the folder that is used by the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
